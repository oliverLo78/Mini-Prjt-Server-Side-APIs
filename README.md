# 🏗️ Implement a fetch() Request to Display MMA events and fighters

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I click the "Fetch MMA fighters and events" button, and a list of MMA Figthers/Events displays on the page.

## 💡 Hints

* How can we use the [sportsdata API documentation on repositories](https://sportsdata.io/developers/api-documentation/mma#/sports-data/league-feeds) to support this implementation?

* Where in the URL string is the endpoint added?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* In `fetch()` requests we use the URL. What is the difference between a URL and URI? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

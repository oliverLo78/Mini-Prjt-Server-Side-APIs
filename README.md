## 💡 Hints

* How can we use the [octagon API documentation on repositories](https://www.octagon-api.com/) to support this implementation?

* Where in the URL string is the endpoint added?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* In `fetch()` requests we use the URL. What is the difference between a URL and URI? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
